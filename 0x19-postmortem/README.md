# 0x19-postmortem
 - Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)
 - Make your post-mortem attractive by adding humour, a pretty diagram or anything that would catch your audience attention.
